            <h4 class="parrafo px-4 mx-4 pb-3">Everyday I wake up in search of courage and authentic expression. And on this journey, I've been met with opportunities to create impact in ways I'd never imagine. Janaury 2018 I became the inaugural Creative Director at Blavity, a global media platform that empowers Black creators with tools to change the world.</h4>

            <h4 class="parrafo px-4 mx-4 pb-3">On May 4, 2017, I married my partner of 7 years in Nassau, Bahamas. I'm forever grateful for the outpour of love and admiration we received for this moment. To know that our family and friends felt appreciated, deeply connected, and free to be themselves at our celebration meant to the world to me.</h4>

            <h4 class="parrafo px-4 mx-4 pb-3"> I stumbled across an opportunity to build something my family and friends would be proud of—and I ultimately took a leap of faith to join Silicon Valley startup. Walker & Company gave me a first-hand experience in building a venture-backed business from ground up, and got me re-acquainted with my technical roots.</h4>

            <h4 class="parrafo px-4 mx-4 pb-3">NYC, my home from 2014-2016, gave me space to grow as a designer, and helped me see myself more as an artist. With every lens snapped and every pixel laid, I became more of who I was meant to be. <br><br>Photo by Aundre Larrow</h4>

            <h4 class="parrafo px-4 mx-4 pb-3">My first day-job in Advertising bridged my intuition for design and my technical education as a product engineer. From Boston to New York, I helped Fortune 500 brands find their voice in a noisy, digital world as I continued to develop my own.</h4>

            <h4 class="parrafo px-4 mx-4 pb-3">The Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES) program opened my mind to a world I never knew existed. MITES not only provided the needed academic challenge but it gave me a holistic, global perspective— one I did get growing up on the West-side of Chicago. It was here where the sleeping the giant awoke within me.</h4>

            <h4 class="parrafo px-4 mx-4 pb-3">My high school will always be my heart. The campus wasn’t always the safest, and the facilities weren’t state-of-the-art— but I experienced such a great love and community. I got the best education possible from teachers and staff that cared about my future. And I undoubtably developed a character rooted in love, honesty and compassion. As a Proviso East Pirate, I will forever bleed blue.</h4>
